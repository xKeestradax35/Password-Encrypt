# Password Encrypt

Keep your passwords secure and always at your fingertips with Password Encrypt. Store and manage all your passwords locally on your device with state-of-the-art encryption, ensuring both convenience and top-notch security.


## Features

- Local Storage: All data is stored locally on your device. No cloud, no servers, just you and your device.
- Top-notch Encryption: Rest assured, your passwords are stored with high-level encryption algorithms.
- Face ID & Code Authentication: Access the app securely using Face ID or a numerical code, depending on your device and preferences.
- Easy Account Management: Add, view, or delete your accounts with ease. Plus, you can add both the email/username and password for each account.

## How It Works
    
1. Authentication: Launch the app and authenticate using either Face ID or your unique code.
1. Account Overview: View a list of your stored accounts. Here, you'll see just the account names (e.g., Google, Facebook) for quick navigation without compromising security.
1. Add New Account: Tap on 'Add' to save a new account. Enter the account name (e.g., Google), your username or email, and your password. The app will encrypt and store this information securely.
1. Retrieve Password: If you ever need to see a password, select the account and authenticate again for an additional layer of security.
## Example

John recently updated his Google account's password as part of a regular security protocol. He doesn't want to risk forgetting the new complex password he set. After opening **Password Encrypt** and authenticating with Face ID, he chooses to add his Google account, inputs his email, and the new password. Now, John can access his password anytime he needs it, securely and easily.

## Roadmap

We're currently in the alpha version and have big plans for **Password Encrypt** future. Here are some of the things on our roadmap:

- Backup & Restore: Implement a secure way to back up the encrypted data locally, such as to an external SD card or USB drive, and restore it if needed.

- Multi-device Syncing: Introduce a safe and encrypted method for users to sync their data across multiple devices without using cloud storage.

- Password Generator: Integrate a built-in password generator that helps users create strong, unique passwords for their accounts.

- Security Notifications: Send notifications to users when a stored account password hasn't been changed for an extended period, encouraging regular updates for security.

- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Support: Allow users to store 2FA recovery codes, ensuring they never lose access to their accounts.

- Search Functionality: Incorporate a search bar to quickly locate and manage specific accounts, especially useful for users with numerous saved accounts.

- Breached Password Alert: Integrate with a service like 'Have I Been Pwned' to alert users if a stored password has been involved in a known data breach.

- Biometric Authentication Updates: As technology advances, make sure the app stays compatible with the latest biometric authentication methods, such as iris scanning.

- Security Challenge: A feature that reviews stored passwords and highlights weak, duplicate, or old passwords, suggesting changes.

- Cross-Platform Support: Expand the app's compatibility to include other platforms, like desktop or web applications.

- Customizable Themes: Allow users to customize the app's appearance with different color schemes or themes.

- Import/Export: Offer the capability to securely import or export stored data from other password managers or formats.

- Auto-Fill Integration: Build integration with system-wide auto-fill functionalities, allowing users to easily use stored passwords in their daily web browsing or app usage.
